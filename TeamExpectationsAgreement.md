# Team Expectations Agreement

As a team, we agree to the following expectations:

1. **Preparation:** Each member will prepare for group meetings by reading the assigned material and completing any required work.

2. **Attendance:** Each team member undertakes to participate in a weekly meeting, which will be held during Friday classes from 9:15 - 12:15. If the group needs more than three hours for talks, then an additional meeting will be held on Tuesday after 7 p.m. We will make every effort to attend all group meetings and will communicate with the group in advance if we are unable to attend.

3. **Communication:** We will communicate openly and honestly with each other, respecting each other's opinions and perspectives. We will actively listen and ask questions to ensure everyone understands all solutions.

4. **Conflict Resolution:** When conflicts arise, we will work to resolve them in a respectful and constructive manner. We will address issues directly with the individuals involved and seek input from the group as needed.

5. **Timeliness:** We will complete assigned tasks on time and communicate with the group if we are unable to meet a deadline.

6. **Participation:** We will actively participate in group discussions and contribute to the completion of assigned tasks.

7. **Keeping work up to date:** After completing some part of work, we will update board at Github repository to keep each task status consistent with reality.

Each member of the team agrees to these expectations and intends to fulfill them to the best of their ability. We understand that these expectations are for our use and benefit and will not be graded or commented on unless we specifically ask for feedback. We have shared this document with our supervisor and will keep a copy online for future reference.
