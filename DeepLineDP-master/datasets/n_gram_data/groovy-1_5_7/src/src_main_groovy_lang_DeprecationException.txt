* use this exception to mark a method implementation as being deprecated.

* use the message to indicate the recommended way of calling the desired functionality.
* make throwing this exception the only line in the method implementation, i.e. unlike
* the javadoc deprecated feature there is no relay to the new implementation but an early
* and deliberate halt of execution ("fail early").
*
* this exception is supposed to be used in the snapshot releases only. before release, all
* references to this exception should be resolved and the according methods removed.
