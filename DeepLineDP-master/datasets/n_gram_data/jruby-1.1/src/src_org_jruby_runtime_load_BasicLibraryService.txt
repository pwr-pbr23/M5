* this interface should be implemented by writers of java extensions to jruby.

* gets loaded. it is therefore prudent that it established the environment
* the extension wants to have. for example, creating new modules and classes,
* adding methods to these and describe which implementation will get used.
*
* this interface details the standard load mechanism for easy extensions.
* implement the interface in a class outlined in the javadoc for loadservice,
* put the class into a jar-file and put it on jruby's load path, and you're
* set to go.
