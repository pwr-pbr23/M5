/**
* listens for requests regarding resources. such resources are typically
* non-static in nature and may even be created on the fly.
* <p>
* one use for resource listeners is that they may be used to create components
* such as image which respond to requests with a localized resource loaded from
* the classpath. the image class allows reusable components to transparently
* bundle localized image resources. components that use image resources
* (instead of referencing static images in their markup) can be distributed as
* a self-contained jar file.
