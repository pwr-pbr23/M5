/**
* optional interface for {@link iinitializer initializers} that can clean up
* stuff initializers created. initializers simple have to implement this
* interface and do their thing in {@link #destroy(application)}.
* <p>
* destroyers can be used to cleanup code when the application unloads. it only
* guarantees a best effort of cleaning up. typically, for web applications,
* this is called when the wicket servlet/ filter is unloaded by the container,
* which may depend on the container's implementation and things like the time
* out period it uses and whether all threads of the web app were cleared.
