/**
* represents a service locator for lazy init proxies. when the first method
* invocation occurs on the lazy init proxy this locator will be used to
* retrieve the proxy target object that will receive the method invocation.
* <p>
* generally implementations should be small when serialized because the main
* purpose of lazy init proxies is to be stored in session when the wicket pages
* are serialized, and when deserialized to be able to lookup the dependency
* again. the smaller the implementation of iproxytargetlocator the less the
* drain on session size.
* <p>
* a small implementation may use a static lookup to retrieve the target object.
* <p>
* example:
*
* <pre>
* class userservicelocator implements iproxytargetlocator
* {
* 	object locateproxyobject()
* 	{
* 		myapplication app = (myapplication) application.get();
* 		return app.getuserservice();
* 	}
* }
* </pre>
