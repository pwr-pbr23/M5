package org apache wicket
/**
* base interface for all interfaces that listen for requests from the client
* browser. all sub-interfaces of this interface must have a single method which
* takes no arguments.
* <p>
* new listener interfaces must be registered with wicket by constructing a
* {@link requestlistenerinterface} object for the given interface class. the
* best way to do this is to create a public static final constant field in your
* request listener interface. doing this will cause the interface to
* automatically register whenever it is used. for example, see
* {@link org.apache.wicket.iredirectlistener#interface}.
