* a request target is the base entity that is the subject of a request.
* different types of request have different request targets. for instance a
* request for a bookmarkable page differs from a request for a link on a
* previously rendered page, which in turn differs from a request for a shared
* resource.
* </p>
* <p>
* it is very important (for mounting) that implementations implement
* {@link java.lang.object#equals(java.lang.object)} and
* {@link java.lang.object#hashcode()} in a consistent way.
* </p>
* typically, implementations of irequesttarget are not meant to be used more
* than once.
