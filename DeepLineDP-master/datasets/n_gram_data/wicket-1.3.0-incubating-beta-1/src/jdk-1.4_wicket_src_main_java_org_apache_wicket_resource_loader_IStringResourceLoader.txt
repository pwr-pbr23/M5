/**
* the string resource loader interface allows a strategy pattern to be applied
* to the loading of resource strings for an application. the loader (or chain
* of loaders) that are used is configured via the application settings.
* <p>
* each particular implementation of this interface may define its own mechanism
* for searching for resources. please see the documents for each particular
* implementation to determine its behavior and to see how it can be configured.
* <p>
* it is important to note that if a resource is not found by a particular
* loader than the loader should return <code>null</code> rather than throw an
* exception. the reason for this is that loaders can be arranged in a chain and
* it would be very inefficient for loaders earlier in the chain to throw
* exceptions that must be caught and handled each time until the correct loader
* in the chain is reached.
