* this interface makes it trivial to use busy indicators for ajax requests.
* this interface can be implemented by a component that has an ajax behavior
* attached to it, or by the ajax behavior itself. if this is the case
* javascript will be added automatically that will show a markup element
* pointed to by the {@link #getajaxindicatormarkupid()} markup id attribute
* when the ajax request begins, and hide it when the ajax requests succeeds or
* fails.
* <p>
* if both a component and a behavior implement this interface, the component
* will take precedence.
