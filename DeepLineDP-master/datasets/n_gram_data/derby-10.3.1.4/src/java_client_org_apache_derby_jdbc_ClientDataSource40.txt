/**
* clientdatasource40 is a simple data source implementation
* that can be used for establishing connections in a
* non-pooling, non-distributed environment.
* the class clientconnectionpooldatasource40 can be used in a connection pooling environment,
* and the class clientxadatasource40 can be used in a distributed, and pooling
* environment. use these datasources if your application runs under
* jdbc4.0. use the corresponding clientdatasource, clientconnectionpooldatasource, and
* clientxadatasource classes if
* your application runs in the following environments:
* <p/>
*	<ul>
*	<li> jdbc 3.0 - java 2 - jdk 1.4, j2se 5.0
*	<li> jdbc 2.0 - java 2 - jdk 1.2,1.3
* </ul>
*
* <p>the example below registers a dnc data source object with a jndi naming service.
* <pre>
* org.apache.derby.client.clientdatasource40 datasource = new org.apache.derby.client.clientdatasource40 ();
* datasource.setservername ("my_derby_database_server");
* datasource.setdatabasename ("my_derby_database_name");
* javax.naming.context context = new javax.naming.initialcontext();
* context.bind ("jdbc/my_datasource_name", datasource);
* </pre>
* the first line of code in the example creates a data source object.
* the next two lines initialize the data source's
* properties. then a java object that references the initial jndi naming
* context is created by calling the
* initialcontext() constructor, which is provided by jndi.
* system properties (not shown) are used to tell jndi the
* service provider to use. the jndi name space is hierarchical,
* similar to the directory structure of many file
* systems. the data source object is bound to a logical jndi name
* by calling context.bind(). in this case the jndi name
* identifies a subcontext, "jdbc", of the root naming context
* and a logical name, "my_datasource_name", within the jdbc
* subcontext. this is all of the code required to deploy
* a data source object within jndi. this example is provided
* mainly for illustrative purposes. we expect that developers
* or system administrators will normally use a gui tool to
* deploy a data source object.
* <p/>
* once a data source has been registered with jndi,
* it can then be used by a jdbc application, as is shown in the
* following example.
* <pre>
* javax.naming.context context = new javax.naming.initialcontext ();
* javax.sql.datasource datasource = (javax.sql.datasource) context.lookup ("jdbc/my_datasource_name");
* java.sql.connection connection = datasource.getconnection ("user", "password");
* </pre>
* the first line in the example creates a java object
* that references the initial jndi naming context. next, the
* initial naming context is used to do a lookup operation
* using the logical name of the data source. the
* context.lookup() method returns a reference to a java object,
* which is narrowed to a javax.sql.datasource object. in
* the last line, the datasource.getconnection() method
* is called to produce a database connection.
* <p/>
* this simple data source subclass of clientbasedatasource maintains
* it's own private <code>password</code> property.
* <p/>
* the specified password, along with the user, is validated by derby.
* this property can be overwritten by specifing
* the password parameter on the datasource.getconnection() method call.
* <p/>
* this password property is not declared transient, and therefore
* may be serialized to a file in clear-text, or stored
* to a jndi server in clear-text when the data source is saved.
* care must taken by the user to prevent security
* breaches.
* <p/>
