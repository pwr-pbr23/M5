/**
* extends the basic <code>reducer</code> class to add the required key and
* value input/output classes. while the input key and value as well as the
* output key can be anything handed in from the previous map phase the output
* value <u>must</u> be either a {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.put put}
* or a {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.delete delete} instance when
* using the {@link tableoutputformat} class.
* <p>
* this class is extended by {@link identitytablereducer} but can also be
* subclassed to implement similar features or any custom code needed. it has
* the advantage to enforce the output value to a specific basic type.
*
* @param <keyin>  the type of the input key.
* @param <valuein>  the type of the input value.
* @param <keyout>  the type of the output key.
