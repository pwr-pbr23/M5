/**
* provides row-level filters applied to hregion scan results during calls to
* {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.resultscanner#next()}.
<p>
filters run the extent of a table unless you wrap your filter in a
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.filter.whilematchfilter}.
the latter returns as soon as the filter stops matching.
</p>
<p>do not rely on filters carrying state across rows; its not reliable in current
hbase as we have no handlers in place for when regions split, close or server
crashes.
