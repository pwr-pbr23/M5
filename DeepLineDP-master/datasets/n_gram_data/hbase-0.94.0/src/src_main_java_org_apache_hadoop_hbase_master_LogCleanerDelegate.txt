* cleaners: <code>timetolivelogcleaner</code> and
* <code>replicationlogcleaner</code> are called in order. so if other
* effects are needed, implement your own logcleanerdelegate and add it to the
* configuration "hbase.master.logcleaner.plugins", which is a comma-separated
* list of fully qualified class names. logscleaner will add it to the chain.
*
* <p>hbase ships with logscleaner as the default implementation.
*
* <p>this interface extends configurable, so setconf needs to be called once
* before using the cleaner.
* since logcleanerdelegates are created in logscleaner by reflection. classes
* that implements this interface should provide a default constructor.
