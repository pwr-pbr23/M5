</ul>
<h2><a name="overview">overview</a></h2>
<p>to administer hbase, create and drop tables, list and alter tables,
use {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.hbaseadmin}.  once created, table access is via an instance
of {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.htable}.  you add content to a table a row at a time.  to insert,
create an instance of a {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.put} object.  specify value, target column
and optionally a timestamp.  commit your update using {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.htable#put(put)}.
to fetch your inserted value, use {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.get}.  the get can be specified to be broad -- get all
on a particular row -- or narrow; i.e. return only a single cell value.   after creating an instance of
get, invoke {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.htable#get(get)}.  use
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.scan} to set up a scanner -- a cursor- like access.  after
creating and configuring your scan instance, call {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.htable#getscanner(scan)} and then
invoke next on the returned object.  both {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.htable#get(get)} and
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.htable#getscanner(scan)} return a
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.result}.
a result is a list of {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.keyvalue}s.  it has facility for packaging the return
in different formats.
use {@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.delete} to remove content.
you can remove individual cells or entire families, etc.  pass it to
{@link org.apache.hadoop.hbase.client.htable#delete(delete)} to execute.
</p>
<p>puts, gets and deletes take out a lock on the target row for the duration of their operation.
concurrent modifications to a single row are serialized.  gets and scans run concurrently without
interference of the row locks and are guaranteed to not to return half written rows.
</p>
<p>client code accessing a cluster finds the cluster by querying zookeeper.
this means that the zookeeper quorum to use must be on the client classpath.
usually this means make sure the client can find your <code>hbase-site.xml</code>.
</p>
<h2><a name="client_example">example api usage</a></h2>
<p>once you have a running hbase, you probably want a way to hook your application up to it.
if your application is in java, then you should use the java api. here's an example of what
a simple client might look like.  this example assumes that you've created a table called
"mytable" with a column family called "mycolumnfamily".

// you need a configuration object to tell the client where to connect.

// this instantiates an htable object that connects you to

htable table = new htable(config, "mylittlehbasetable");
// to add to a row, use put.  a put constructor takes the name of the row
// you want to insert into as a byte array.  in hbase, the bytes class has
// utility for converting all kinds of java types to byte arrays.  in the
// below, we are converting the string "mylittlerow" into a byte array to
// use as a row key for our update. once you have a put instance, you can
// adorn it by setting the names of columns you want to update on the row,
// the timestamp to use in your update, etc.if no timestamp, the server
// applies current time to the edits.
put p = new put(bytes.tobytes("mylittlerow"));
// to set the value you'd like to update in the row 'mylittlerow', specify
// the column family, column qualifier, and value of the table cell you'd
// like to update.  the column family must already exist in your table
// schema.  the qualifier can be anything.  all must be specified as byte
// arrays as hbase is all about byte arrays.  lets pretend the table
// 'mylittlehbasetable' was created with a family 'mylittlefamily'.

// once you've adorned your put instance with all the updates you want to
// make, to commit it do the following (the htable#put method takes the
// put instance you've been building and pushes the changes you made into
// hbase)
table.put(p);
// now, to retrieve the data we just wrote. the values that come back are
// result instances. generally, a result is an object that will package up
// the hbase return into the form you find most palatable.
get g = new get(bytes.tobytes("mylittlerow"));
result r = table.get(g);
byte [] value = r.getvalue(bytes.tobytes("mylittlefamily"),
bytes.tobytes("somequalifier"));
// if we convert the value bytes, we should get back 'some value', the
// value we inserted at this location.
string valuestr = bytes.tostring(value);
system.out.println("get: " + valuestr);
// sometimes, you won't know the row you're looking for. in this case, you
// use a scanner. this will give you cursor-like interface to the contents
// of the table.  to set up a scanner, do like you did above making a put
// and a get, create a scan.  adorn it with column names, etc.
scan s = new scan();
s.addcolumn(bytes.tobytes("mylittlefamily"), bytes.tobytes("somequalifier"));

try {
// scanners return result instances.
// now, for the actual iteration. one way is to use a while loop like so:
for (result rr = scanner.next(); rr != null; rr = scanner.next()) {
// print out the row we found and the columns we were looking for
system.out.println("found row: " + rr);
}
// the other approach is to use a foreach loop. scanners are iterable!
// for (result rr : scanner) {
//   system.out.println("found row: " + rr);
// }
} finally {
// make sure you close your scanners when you are done!
// thats why we have it inside a try/finally clause
scanner.close();

<p>there are many other methods for putting data into and getting data out of
hbase, but these examples should get you started. see the htable javadoc for
more methods. additionally, there are methods for managing tables in the
hbaseadmin class.</p>
<p>if your client is not java, then you should consider the thrift or rest
libraries.</p>
