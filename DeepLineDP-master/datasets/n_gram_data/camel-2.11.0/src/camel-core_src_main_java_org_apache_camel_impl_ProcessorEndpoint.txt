* <p/>
* <br/>implementors beware that this endpoint creates producers and consumers which
* doesn't allow you full control of its lifecycle as a {@link org.apache.camel.service}
* or {@link org.apache.camel.suspendableservice} would do.
* if your producers/consumers need more control of its lifecycle its adviced instead to extend
