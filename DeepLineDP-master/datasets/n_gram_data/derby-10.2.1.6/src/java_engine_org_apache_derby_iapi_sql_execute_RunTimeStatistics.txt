* a runtimestatistics object is a representation of the query execution plan and run
* time statistics for a java.sql.resultset.
*
* a query execution plan is a tree
* of execution nodes.  there are a number of possible node types.  statistics
* are accumulated during execution at each node.  the types of statistics include
* the amount of time spent in specific operations (if statistics timing is set on),
* the number of rows passed to the node by its child(ren) and the number of rows
* returned by the node to its parent.  (the exact statistics are specific to each
* node type.)
* <p>
* runtimestatistics is most meaningful for dml statements (select, insert, delete
* and update).
