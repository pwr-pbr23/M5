// store the protocol type. this is needed to know
// which protocol type the mdd override is for.
int protocoltype_
// the fd:oca field type indicator shows exactly how the data is represented
// in the environment.  see the fd:oca reference for a detailed explanation of
// these types.
int fdocafieldtype_
// this is the representation used by the dnc converters.  this is like the
// fd:oca field type but the dnc converters don't use fd:oca types as input.
int representation_
// the ccsid identifies the encoding of the character data.  converting the
// ccsid into binary form generates the four byte representation.  the
// fd:oca rules state that if the high order 16 bits of the ccsid field
// are zero, then the low order 16 bits are to be interpreted as a ccsid
int ccsid_
// indicates the number of bytes each character takes in storage.
// 1 is used for character, date, time, timestamp, and numeric character fields.
// it must be 0 for all other types.
int charactersize_
// this is used to specify mode of interpretation of fd:oca
// architecture for all variable length data types (including null
// terminated), that as the sbcs variable character type.  the
// low order bit of this byte is used to control interpretation
// of length fields in sdas for variable length types.  a '0' in that
// bit indicates that non-zero length field values indicate the space
// reserved for data and that all the space is transmitted
// whether or not it contains valid data.  in the case of variable
// length types, the first two bytes of the data itself determine
// the valid data length.  a '1' in this bit shows that non-zero length
// field values indicate the maximum value of the length fields
// that the data will contain.  only enough space to contain each
// data value is transmitted for each value.
int mode_
// this represents the maximum valid value.  when and if a group
// data array (gda) triplet overrides it, the value can be reduced.
// for character fields with only dbcs characters, this is the length in
// characters (bytes/2).  for all other cases, the length is in bytes.
// it does not include the length of the length field (variable length
// types) or null indicator (nullable types).
//
int fieldlength_
// this is a group of types which indicates how the data length are computed.
