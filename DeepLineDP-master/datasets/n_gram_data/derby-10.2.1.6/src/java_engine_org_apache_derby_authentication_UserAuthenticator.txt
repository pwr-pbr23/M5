/**
* the userauthenticator interface provides operations to authenticate
* a user's credentials in order to successfully connect to a database.
*
* any user authentication schemes could be implemented using this interface
* and registered at start-up time.
* <p>
* if an application requires its own authentication scheme, then it can
* implement this interface and register as the authentication scheme
* that derby should call upon connection requests to the system.
see the dcoumentation for the property <i>derby.authentication.provider</i>
* <p>
* a typical example would be to implement user authentication using
* ldap, sun nis+, or even windows user domain, using this interface.
* <p>
* <i>note</i>: additional connection attributes can be specified on the
* database connection url and/or properties object on jdbc connection. values
* for these attributes can be retrieved at runtime by the (specialized)
* authentication scheme to further help user authentication, if one needs
* additional info other than user, password, and database name.
