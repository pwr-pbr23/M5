/**
the orderable interface represents a value that can
be linearly ordered.
<p>
currently only supports linear (<, =, <=) operations.
eventually we may want to do other types of orderings,
in which case there would probably be a number of interfaces
for each "class" of ordering.
<p>
the implementation must handle the comparison of null
values.  this may require some changes to the interface,
since (at least in some contexts) comparing a value with
null should return unknown instead of true or false.
