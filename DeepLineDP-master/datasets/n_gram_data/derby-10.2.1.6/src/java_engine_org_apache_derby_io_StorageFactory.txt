/**
* this interface provides basic storage functions needed for read only databases. most storage
* implementations will be read-write and implement the writablestoragefactory extension of this
* interface.
*
*<p>
* the database engine uses this interface to access storage. the normal database engine
* implements this interface using disk files and the standard java.io classes.
*
*<p>
* the storage factory must implement writable temporary files, even if the database is read-only or
* if the storage factory is read-only (i.e. it does not implement the writablestoragefactory extension of this
* interface). temporary files are those created under the temporary file directory. see
* {@link #gettempdir method gettempdir()}.
*
*<p>the database engine can be turned into a ram based engine by providing a ram based implementation of this interface.
*
*<p>there is one instance of the storagefactory per database if the log files are kept in the database directory.
* if the log files are kept on a separate device then a second storagefactory is instantiated to hold the log files.
* the database or log device name is set when the init method is called.
* the init method is called once per instance, before any other storagefactory method.
*
*<p>the class implementing this interface must have a public niladic constructor. the init method will be called
* before any other method to set the database directory name, to tell the factory to create the database
* directory if necessary, and to allow the implementation to perform any initializations it requires. the
* database name set in the init method forms a separate name space. different storagefactory instances, with
* different database directory names, must ensure that their files do not clash. so, for instance,
* storagefactory1.newstoragefile( "x") must be a separate file from storagefactory2.newstoragefile( "x").
*
*<p>the database engine will call this interface's methods from its own privilege blocks. this does not give
* a storagefactory implementation carte blanche: a security manager can still forbid the implemeting class from
* executing a privileged action. however, the security manager will not look in the calling stack beyond the
* database engine.
*
*<p>each storagefactory instance may be concurrently used by multiple threads. each storagefactory implementation
* must be thread safe.
*
*<p>a storagefactory implementation is plugged into the database engine via a sub-protocol. sub-protocol <i>xxx</i> is
* tied to a storagefactory implementation class via the derby.subsubprotocol.<i>xxx</i> system property. so,
* to use storagefactory implementation class mystoragefactory with database mydb you would set the system
* property "derby.subsubprotocol.mysf=mystoragefactory" and use the url "jdbc:derby:mysf:mydb" to
* connect to the database.
