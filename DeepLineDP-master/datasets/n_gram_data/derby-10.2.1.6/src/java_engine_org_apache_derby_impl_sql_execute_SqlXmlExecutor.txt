/**
* this class is really just an execution time "utility" that
* makes calls to methods on the xmldatavalue interface.  instances
* of this class are generated at execution time by the various
* derby xml operators--one instance for each row in the target
* result set--and then the appropriate operator call is made on
* that instance (see, for example, the generateexpression() methods
* in unaryoperatornode and binaryoperatornode).  when an instance
* of this class is instantiated, one of the arguments that can be
* provided is an id that is used to retrieve an already-constructed
* (from compilation time) instance of sqlxmlutil from the current
* activation.  when it comes time to execute the operator, this class
* just makes the appropriate call on the received xmldatavalue object
* and passes in the sqlxmlutil, from which the xmldatavalue can
* retrieve compile-time objects.  the xmldatavalue can also make
* calls to various xml-specific utilities on the sqlxmlutil
* object.
*
* let's take an example.  assume the statement that the user
* wants to execute is:
*
*   select id from xtable
*      where xmlexists('/simple' passing by ref xcol)
*
* at compilation time we will compile the expression "/simple"
* and store the compiled version of the query into an instance
* of sqlxmlutil.  then we will save that instance of sqlxmlutil
* as an object in the statement activation, from which we will
* receive an id that can be used later to retrieve the object
* (i.e. to retrieve the sqlxmlutil).  then, for *each* row
* in xtable, we'll generate the following:
*
*  boolean result =
*    (new sqlxmlexecutor(activation, compiletimeobjectid)).
*      xmlexists("/simple", xcol);
*
* in other words, for each row we create a new instance of
* this class and call "xmlexists" on that instance.  then,
* as seen below, we retrieve the sqlxmlutil from the activation
* and pass that into a call to "xmlexists" on the xml value
* itself (i.e. xcol).  xmldatavalue.xmlexists() then uses the
* methods and objects (which include the compiled query
* expression for "/simple") defined on sqlxmlutil to complete
* the operation.
*
* okay, so why do we use this execution-time sqlxmlexecutor class
* instead of just generating a call to xmldatavalue.xmlexists()
* directly?  the reason is that we only want to compile the xml
* query expression once per statement--and where possible we'd
* also like to only generate re-usable xml-specific objects
* once per statement, as well.  if instead we generated a call to
* xmldatavalue.xmlexists() directly for each row, then we would
* have to either pass in the expression string and have xmldatavalue
* compile it, or we would have to compile the expression string
* and then pass the compiled object into xmldatavalue--in either
* case, we'd end up compiling the xml query expression (and creating
* the corresponding xml-specific objects) once for each row in
* the target result set.  by using the "saveobject" functionality
* in activation along with this sqlxmlexecutor class, we make
* it so that we only have to compile the xml query expression and
* create xml-specific objects once (at compile time), and then
* we can re-use those objects for every row in the target
* result set.  yes, we're still creating an instance of this
* class (sqlxmlexecutor) once per row, and yes we have to fetch
* the appropriate sqlxmlutil object once per row, but this is
* still going to be cheaper than having to re-compile the query
* expression and re-create xml objects for every row.
*
* so in short, this class allows us to improve the execution-time
* performance of xml operators by allowing us to create xml-
* specific objects and compile xml query expressions once per
* statement, instead of once per row.
*
* one final note: the reason this class is in this package
* instead of the types package is that, in order to retrieve
* the compile-time objects, we have to use the "getsavedobject()"
* method on the activation.  but the activation class is part
* of the sql layer (org.apache.derby.iapi.sql.activation) and
* we want to keep the types layer independent of the sql layer
* because the types can be used during recovery before the sql
* system has booted.  so the next logical choices were the compile
* package (impl.sql.compile) or the execution package; of those,
* the execution package seems more appropriate since this
* class is only instantiated and used during execution, not
* during compilation.
