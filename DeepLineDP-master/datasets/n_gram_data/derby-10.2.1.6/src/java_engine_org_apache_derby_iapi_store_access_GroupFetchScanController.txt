/**
this scan controller can only be used for group fetch, no update
operations are supported, use scancontroller if you need scan interfaces
other than group fetch.
<p>
in general group fetch will be more efficient than using the
scancontroller fetchnext() interface to get rows one at a time.  the
performance comes from reducing the per call overhead of getting
a row.  also this interface can, depending on the requested isolation
level, possibly do more efficient locking.
<p>
group fetch scans are opened from a transactioncontroller.

/**
* fetch the next n rows from the table.
* <p>
* the client allocates an array of n rows and passes it into the
* fetchnextset() call.  the client must at least allocate a row and
* set row_array[0] to this row.  the client can optionally either leave
* the rest of array entries null, or allocate rows to the slots.
* if access finds an entry to be null, and wants to read a row into
* it, it will allocate a row to the slot.  once fetchnextgroup() returns
* "ownership" of the row passes back to the client, access will not
* keep references to the allocated row.  expected usage is that
* the client will specify an array of some number (say 10), and then
* only allocate a single row.  this way if only 1 row qualifies only
* one row will have been allocated.
* <p>
* this routine does the equivalent of n
* fetchnext() calls, filling in each of the rows in the array.
* locking is performed exactly as if the n fetchnext() calls had
* been made.
* <p>
* it is up to access how many rows to return.  fetchnextgroup() will
* return how many rows were filled in.  if fetchnextgroup() returns 0
* then the scan is complete, (ie. the scan is in the same state as if
* fetchnext() had returned false).  if the scan is not complete then
* fetchnext() will return (1 <= row_count <= n).
* <p>
* the current position of the scan is undefined if fetchnextset()
* is used (ie. mixing fetch()/fetchnext() and fetchnextset() calls
* in a single scan does not work).  this is because a fetchnextset()
* request for 5 rows from a heap where the first 2 rows qualify, but
* no other rows qualify will result in the scan being positioned at
* the end of the table, while if 5 rows did qualify the scan will be
* positioned on the 5th row.
* <p>
* if the row loc array is non-null then for each row fetched into
* the row array, a corresponding fetchlocation() call will be made to
* fill in the rowloc_array.  this array, like the row array can be
* initialized with only one non-null rowlocation and access will
* allocate the rest on demand.
* <p>
* qualifiers, start and stop positioning of the openscan are applied
* just as in a normal scan.
* <p>
* the columns of the row will be the standard columns returned as
* part of a scan, as described by the validcolumns - see openscan for
* description.
* <p>
* expected usage:
*
* // allocate an array of 5 empty rows
* datavaluedescriptor[][] row_array = allocate_row_array(5);
* int row_cnt = 0;
*
* scan = openscan();
*
* while ((row_cnt = scan.fetchnextset(row_array, null) != 0)
* {
*     // i got "row_cnt" rows from the scan.  these rows will be
*     // found in row_array[0] through row_array[row_cnt - 1]
* }
*
* <p>
* @return the number of qualifying rows found and copied into the
*         provided array of rows.  if 0 then the scan is complete,
*         otherwise the return value will be:
*         1 <= row_count <= row_array.length
*
* @param row_array         the array of rows to copy rows into.
*                          row_array[].length must >= 1.   the first entry
*                          must be non-null destination rows, other entries
*                          may be null and will be allocated by access
*                          if needed.
*
* @param rowloc_array      if non-null, the array of row locations to
*                          copy into.  if null, no row locations are
*                          retrieved.
