/**
the storecostcontroller interface provides methods that an access client
(most likely the system optimizer) can use to get store's estimated cost of
various operations on the conglomerate the storecostcontroller was opened
for.
<p>
it is likely that the implementation of storecostcontroller will open
the conglomerate and will leave the conglomerate open until the
storecostcontroller is closed.  this represents a significant amount of
work, so the caller if possible should attempt to open the storecostcontroller
once per unit of work and rather than close and reopen the controller.  for
instance if the optimizer needs to cost 2 different scans against a single
conglomerate, it should use one instance of the storecostcontroller.
<p>
the locking behavior of the implementation of a storecostcontroller is
undefined, it may or may not get locks on the underlying conglomerate.  it
may or may not hold locks until end of transaction.
an optimal implementation will not get any locks on the underlying
conglomerate, thus allowing concurrent access to the table by a executing
query while another query is optimizing.
