* a databaseinstant is a quantity which the database associates
*  with events to collate them.
*
* this interface is used in the column sys.syssyncinstants.instant.
* <p>
* assume a database associates a databaseinstant to an event e1. we call this
* i(e1). also assume the same database associates a databaseinstant to a second
* event e2. we call this i(e2). by definition
*
* <ol>
* <li> if i(e1) < i(e2) event e1 occurred before event e2
* <li> if i(e2) = i(e2) event e1 is the same event as e2
* <li> if i(e1) > i(e2) event e1 occurred after event e2
* </ol>
*
* <p>it is not meaningful to compare a databaseinstant from one database with a
* databaseinstant from another. the result of such a comparison is
* undefined. because a database may construct, store and compare huge numbers
* of databaseinstants, this interface does not require an implementation to
* notice when a caller compares a databaseinstants from different databases.
* <p>
* any implementation of this interface must implement value equality, thus
* implementing equals() and hashcode() methods.
