/**
this interface allows access to commit,prepare,abort global transactions
as part of a two phase commit protocol.  these interfaces have been chosen
to be exact implementations required to implement the xaresource interfaces
as part of the jta standard extension.
<p>
it is expected that the following interfaces are only used during the
recovery portion of 2 phase commit, when the transaction manager is
cleaning up after a runtime crash - it is expected that no current context
managers exist for the xid's being operated on.  the "online" two phase commit
protocol will be implemented by calls directly on a transactioncontroller.
<p>
the xaresource interface is a java mapping of the industry standard xa resource
manager interface.  please refer to: x/open cae specification - distributed
transaction processing: the xa specification, x/open document no. xo/cae/91/300
or isbn 1 872630 24 3.
