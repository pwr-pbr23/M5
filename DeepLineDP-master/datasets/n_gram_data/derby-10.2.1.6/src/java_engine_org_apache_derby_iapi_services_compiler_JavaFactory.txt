/**
* javafactory provides generators for java constructs.
* once java constructs have been connected into
* a complete class definition, the class can be generated
* from them.
* the generated class is created as a byte-code array that
* can then be loaded by a class loader or, in our case,
* the class utilities wrapper around our special class loader.
* <p>
* each method shows the equivalent java in the line starting
* "java:" in the header comment.  items in the java code that
* begin with # refer to parameters used in constructing the
* object.  so, for example, newreturnstatement takes a parameter
* named value; its java code is:
* <verbatim>
java: return #value;
</verbatim>
* <p>
* this represents the fact that newreturnstatement returns a
* object that represents a return statement that returns the
* value represented by the parameter named value.
* <p>
* revisit: when standardexception is moved to basicservices,
* all of these want to support it so they can throw
* real notimplementedyet exceptions. it is expected that alot
* of this interface can be not-implemented for engines that
* do not need this complete treatment of the language.
* <p>
* known java constructs missing from this interface include:
* <ul>
* <li> array initializers
* <li> ,-lists of statements in for segments
* <li> accessing a field of the current object or class without
*	including this or the class name
* <li> declaring a list of variables against one type
* <li> conversions/coercions/promotions of types
* <li> empty statement
* <li> labeled statement
* <li> switch statement
* <li> break, continue statements
* <li> "super" expression (akin to the "this" expression).
* <li> operations on multi-dimensional arrays
* </ul>
* <p>
* this interface also does not do real compilation -- there are no
* checks for things like initialization before use of variables,
* inclusion of catchs on throws, dead code, etc. its purpose is to
* let other parts of the system piece together what they know is valid
* code and get bytecode out of doing that.
* <p>
* also, implementations will require that the constructs be built
* appropriately or they may fail to produce a valid class.  for example,
* newstaticmethodcall must be used to call static methods only,
* not non-static local instance methods.
* <p>
* implementations may be more, or less strict.  you are best off assuming
* you have to piece together each java construct and be as explicit as
* possible.  so, constructors must be created with newconstructor, not
* newmethodbuilder; constructors must include the explicit call to
* super(...) or this(...), as their first statement; all methods and
* constructors must contain a final return statement at the end of
* their code path(s). method calls will derive the method to call
* based on the type of the argument, so you must cast arguments as
* the system will not search for a close method and coerce arguments
* appropriately.  this includes coercing them to be some superclass or
* interface that they already are.
