**
** the default size needs some explaining.  as
** of 7/14/98, the most efficient way for access
** to return rows from a table is basically by
** reading/qualifying/returning all the rows in
** one page.  if you are read in many many rows
** at a time the performance gain is only marginally
** better.  anyway, since even a small number of
** rows per read helps, and since there is no good
** way to get access to retrieve the rows page
** by page, we use 16 totally arbitrarily.  ultimately,
** this should be dynamically sized -- in which
** case we wouldn't need this default.
