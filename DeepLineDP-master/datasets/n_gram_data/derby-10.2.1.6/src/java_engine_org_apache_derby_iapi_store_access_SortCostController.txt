/**
* calculate the cost of a sort.
* <p>
* the cost of a sort includes the time spent in the sorter inserting
* the rows into the sort, and the time spent in the sorter returning the
* rows.  note that it does not include the cost of scanning the rows from
* the source table, for insert into the sort.
* <p>
* arguments to getsortcost(), should be the same as those to be passed to
* transactioncontroller.createsort().
*
* @param template        a row which is prototypical for the sort.  all
*                        rows inserted into the sort controller must have
*                        exactly the same number of columns as the
*                        template row.  every column in an inserted row
*                        must have the same type as the corresponding
*                        column in the template.
*
* @param columnordering  an array which specifies which columns
*                        participate in ordering - see interface
*                        columnordering for details.  the column
*                        referenced in the 0th columnordering object is
*                        compared first, then the 1st, etc.
*
* @param alreadyinorder  indicates that the rows inserted into the sort
*                        controller will already be in order.  this is used
*                        to perform aggregation only.
*
* @param estimatedinputrows   the number of rows that the caller estimates
*                        will be inserted into the sort.  this number must
*                        be >= 0.
*
* @param estimatedexportrows   the number of rows that the caller estimates
*                        will be exported by the sorter.  for instance if
*                        the sort is doing duplicate elimination and all
*                        rows are expected to be duplicates then the
*                        estimatedexportrows would be 1.  if no duplicate
*                        eliminate is to be done then estimatedexportrows
*                        would be the same as estimatedinputrows.  this
*                        number must be >= 0.
*
* @param estimatedrowsize the estimated average row size of the rows
*                         being sorted.  this is the client portion of the
*                         rowsize, it should not attempt to calculate
*                         store's overhead.  -1 indicates that the caller
*                         has no idea (and the sorter will use 100 bytes
*                         in that case.  used by the sort to make good
*                         choices about in-memory vs. external sorting,
*                         and to size merge runs.  the client is not
*                         expected to estimate the per column/ per row
*                         overhead of raw store, just to make a guess
*                         about the storage associated with each row
*                         (ie. reasonable estimates for some
*                         implementations would be 4 for int, 8 for long,
*                         102 for char(100), 202 for varchar(200), a
*                         number out of hat for user types, ...).
*
* @return the cost of the sort.
*
* @exception  standardexception  standard exception policy.
