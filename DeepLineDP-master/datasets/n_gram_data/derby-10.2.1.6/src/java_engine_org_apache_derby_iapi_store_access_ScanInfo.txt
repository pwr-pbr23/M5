/**
* return all information gathered about the scan.
* <p>
* this routine returns a list of properties which contains all information
* gathered about the scan.  if a property is passed in, then that property
* list is appeneded to, otherwise a new property object is created and
* returned.
* <p>
* not all scans may support all properties, if the property is not
* supported then it will not be returned.  the following is a list of
* properties that may be returned. these names have been internationalized,
* the names shown here are the old, non-internationalized names:
*
*     scantype
*         - type of the scan being performed:
*           btree
*           heap
*           sort
*     numpagesvisited
*         - the number of pages visited during the scan.  for btree scans
*           this number only includes the leaf pages visited.
*     numdeletedrowsvisited
*         - the number of deleted rows visited during the scan.  this
*           number includes only those rows marked deleted.
*     numrowsvisited
*         - the number of rows visited during the scan.  this number
*           includes all rows, including: those marked deleted, those
*           that don't meet qualification, ...
*     numrowsqualified
*         - the number of rows which met the qualification.
*     treeheight (btree's only)
*         - for btree's the height of the tree.  a tree with one page
*           has a height of 1.  total number of pages visited in a btree
*           scan is (treeheight - 1 + numpagesvisited).
*     numcolumnsfetched
*         - the number of columns fetched - partial scans will result
*           in fetching less columns than the total number in the scan.
*     columnsfetchedbitset
*         - the bitset.tostring() method called on the validcolumns arg.
*           to the scan, unless validcolumns was set to null, and in that
*           case we will return "all".
*     note - this list will be expanded as more information about the scan
*            is gathered and returned.
*
* @param prop   property list to fill in.
*
* @exception  standardexception  standard exception policy.
