* assertfailure is raised when an assert check fails.
* because assertions are not used in production code,
* are never expected to fail, and recovering from their
* failure is expected to be hard, they are under
* runtimeexception so that no one needs to list them
* in their throws clauses.  an assertfailure at the
* outermost system level will result in system shutdown.
