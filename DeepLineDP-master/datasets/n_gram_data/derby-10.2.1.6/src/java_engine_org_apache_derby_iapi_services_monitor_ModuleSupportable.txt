see if this implementation can support any attributes that are listed in properties.
this call may be made on a newly created instance before the
boot() method has been called, or after the boot method has
been called for a running module.
<p>
the module can check for attributes in the properties to
see if it can fulfill the required behaviour. e.g. the raw
store may define an attribute called rawstore.recoverable.
if a temporary raw store is required the property rawstore.recoverable=false
would be added to the properties before calling bootservicemodule. if a
raw store cannot support this attribute its cansupport method would
return null. also see the monitor class's prologue to see how the
identifier is used in looking up properties.
<br><b>actually a better way maybe to have properties of the form
rawstore.attributes.mandatory=recoverable,smallfootprint and
rawstore.attributes.requested=oltp,fast
</b>
@return true if this instance can be used, false otherwise.
