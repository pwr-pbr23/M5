/**
* controller used to provide cost estimates to optimizer about secondary index
* data access.
*
* implements the storecostcontroller interface for the b-tree index
* implementation.  the primary use of this interface is to provide costs
* used by the query optimizer to use when choosing query plans. provides
* costs of things like fetch one row, how many rows in conglomerate, how
* many rows between these 2 keys.
*
* note most work of this class is inherited from the generic btree
* implementation.  this class initializes the top level object and deals with
* locking information specific to a secondary index implementation of a btree.
