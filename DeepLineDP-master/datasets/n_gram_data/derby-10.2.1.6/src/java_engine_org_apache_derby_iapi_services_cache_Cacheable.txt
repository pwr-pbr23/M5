/**
any object that implements this interface can be cached using the services of
the cachemanager/cachefactory. in addition to implementing this interface the
class must be public and it must have a public no-arg constructor. this is because
the cache manager will construct objects itself and then set their identity
by calling the setidentity method.
<p>
a cacheable object has five states:
<ol>
<ol>
<li> no identity - the object is only accessable by the cache manager
<li> identity, clean, unkept - the object has an identity, is clean but is only accessable by the cache manager
<li> identity, clean, kept - the object has an identity, is clean, and is in use by one or more threads
<li> identity, kept, dirty - the object has an identity, is dirty, and is in use by one or more threads
<li> identity, unkept, dirty - the object has an identity, is dirty but is only accessable by the cache manager
</ol>
</ol>
<br>
while the object is kept it is guaranteed
not to change identity. while it is unkept no-one outside of the
cache manager can have a reference to the object.
the cache manager returns kept objects and they return to the unkept state
when all the current users of the object have released it.
<br>
it is required that the object can only move into a dirty state while it is kept.
<br> mt - mutable : thread aware - calls to cacheable method must only be made by the
cache manager or the object itself.

after this call the expression getidentity().equals(key) must return true.
<br>
if the class of the object needs to change (e.g. to support a different format)
then the object should create a new object, call its initparameter() with the parameters
the original object was called with, set its identity and return a reference to it. the cache
manager will discard the reference to the old object.
