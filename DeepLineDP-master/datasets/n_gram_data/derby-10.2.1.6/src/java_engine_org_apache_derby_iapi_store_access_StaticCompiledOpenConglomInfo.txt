/**
information that can be "compiled" once and then used over and over again
at execution time.  this information is read only by both the caller and
the user, thus can be shared by multiple threads/transactions once created.
this information is obtained from the getstaticcompiledconglominfo(conglomid)
method call.  it can then be used in openconglomerate() and openscan() calls
for increased performance.  the information is only valid until the next
ddl operation is performed on the conglomerate.  it is up to the caller to
provide an invalidation methodology.
the static info would be valid until any ddl was executed on the conglomid,
and would be up to the caller to throw away when that happened.  this ties in
with what language already does for other invalidation of static info.  the
type of info in this would be containerid and array of format id's from which
templates can be created.  the info in this object is read only and can
be shared among as many threads as necessary.
