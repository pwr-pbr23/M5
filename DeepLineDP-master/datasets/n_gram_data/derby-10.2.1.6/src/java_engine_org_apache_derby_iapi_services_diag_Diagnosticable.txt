* this interface provides a way for an object to pass back pieces of
* information as requested by the caller.  the information is passed
* back and forth through the properties argument.  it is expected that
* the caller knows what kind of information to ask for, and correctly
* handles the situation when the diagnostic object can't provide the
* information.
* <p>
* as an example assume an object table exists, and that we have created
* an object d_table that knows how to return the number of pages in the
* table object.  the code to get that information out would looks something
* like the following:
* <p>
* print_num_pages(object table)
* {
*     properties prop = new properties();
*     prop.put(page.diag_num_pages,        "");
*
*     diagnosticutil.finddiagnostic(table).diag_detail(prop);
*
*     system.out.println(
*        "number of pages = " + prop.getproperty(page.diag_num_pages));
* }
* <p>
* this routine should be overriden if there is detail diagnostics to
* be provided by a real implementation.
