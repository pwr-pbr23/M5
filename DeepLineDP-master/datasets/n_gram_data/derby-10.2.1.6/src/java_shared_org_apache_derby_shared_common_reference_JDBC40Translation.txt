/**
this class contains public statics that map directly to the
new public statics in the jdbc 4.0 interfaces.  by providing
an intermediary class with hard-coded copies of constants that
will be available in jdbc 4.0, it becomes possible to refer to
these constants when compiling against older jdk versions.
<p>the test <code>jdbc4/jdbc40translationtest.junit</code>,
which is compiled against jdk16, contains tests that verifies
that these hard coded constants are in fact equal to those
found in jdk16.
<p>
this class should not be shipped with the product.
<p>
this class has no methods, all it contains are constants
are public, static and final since they are declared in an interface.
