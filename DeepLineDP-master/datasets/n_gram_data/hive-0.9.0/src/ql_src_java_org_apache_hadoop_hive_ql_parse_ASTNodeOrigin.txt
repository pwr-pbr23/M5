* <code>select v1.y from v as v1</code>, and there's a type-checking problem
* with the expression <code>x+1</code> due to an alter table on t subsequent to
* the creation of v. then, when reporting the error, we want to provide the
* parser location with respect to the definition of v (rather than with respect
* to the top-level query, since that represents a completely different
* "parser coordinate system").
*
*<p>
*
* so, when expanding the definition of v while analyzing the top-level query,
* we tag each astnode with a reference to an astnodeorign describing v and its
* usage within the query.
