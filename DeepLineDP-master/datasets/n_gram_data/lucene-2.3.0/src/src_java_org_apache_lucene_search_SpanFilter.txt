of an index and also maintains and returns position information.
this is useful if you want to compare the positions from a spanquery with the positions of items in
a filter.  for instance, if you had a spanfilter that marked all the occurrences of the word "foo" in documents,
and then you entered a new spanquery containing bar, you could not only filter by the word foo, but you could
then compare position information for post processing.
