/** expert: calculate query weights and build query scorers.
* <p>
* the purpose of weight is to make it so that searching does not modify
* a query, so that a query instance can be reused. <br>
* searcher dependent state of the query should reside in the weight. <br>
* indexreader dependent state should reside in the scorer.
* <p>
* a <code>weight</code> is used in the following way:
* <ol>
* <li>a <code>weight</code> is constructed by a top-level query,
*     given a <code>searcher</code> ({@link query#createweight(searcher)}).
* <li>the {@link #sumofsquaredweights()} method is called
*     on the <code>weight</code> to compute
*     the query normalization factor {@link similarity#querynorm(float)}
*     of the query clauses contained in the query.
* <li>the query normalization factor is passed to {@link #normalize(float)}.
*     at this point the weighting is complete.
* <li>a <code>scorer</code> is constructed by {@link #scorer(indexreader)}.
* </ol>
